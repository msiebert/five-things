  <h1>Getting started with {{ site.title }}</h1>
  <p class="hero-description">
    {{ site.title }} is a quiet daily habit: five new facts each morning, a
    running collection of everything you've learned, and a quiz that
    revisits what's starting to slip. Here's how to make the most of it.

      <div class="guide-step-body">
        <h3>Read today's five things</h3>
        <p>
          Every morning a new entry goes up with five facts on a single
          topic &mdash; a question, an answer, and a short explanation for
          each. Find it on the <a href="{{ '/' | relative_url }}">home
          page</a> under "Today's five things," or browse any past day in
          the journal list below it.

        <h3>Sign in to start collecting</h3>
        <p>
          Click <strong>Sign in with Google</strong> in the header. Signing
          in lets the site remember which facts you've read, so they can
          show up in your quiz later. Nothing is shared beyond your own
          account &mdash; each signed-in user's progress is stored
          separately.

      <div class="guide-step-body">
        <h3>Add facts to your collection</h3>
        <p>
          On any daily entry, click <strong>+ Add to my collection</strong>
          under a fact to save it. Only facts you've collected are eligible
          to appear in your quiz, so add the ones you want to keep sharp
          on.

        <h3>Take the quiz</h3>
        <p>
          The <a href="{{ '/quiz/' | relative_url }}">quiz</a> draws
          twenty-five questions from everything you've collected so far,
          weighted toward facts you've recently missed. Grade yourself
          honestly after each answer &mdash; that's what keeps the
          weighting useful.

        <h3>Come back daily</h3>
        <p>
          The home page tracks your streak and recent accuracy once you've
          signed in. Reading the day's five things and finishing the quiz
          both count toward your daily checkmark &mdash; the habit is the
          point.
