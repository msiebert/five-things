# Per-User Firestore Schema

Each signed-in user's progress lives in exactly one Firestore document in
their own Firebase project — there is no shared or server-side database.
The document holds only fact ID references and timestamps; the fact
content itself always lives in [`assets/data/facts.jsonl`](../assets/data/facts.jsonl)
(see [`fact-store-schema.md`](fact-store-schema.md)) and is looked up by ID
when needed.

## Document location

```
users/{uid}
```

`{uid}` is the Firebase Auth UID of the signed-in Google account
(`user.uid` from the client SDK). The document is created automatically —
with the three fields below set to empty arrays — the first time a user
signs in (see `assets/js/auth.js`, `ensureUserDoc`).

## Fields

| Field            | Type  | Description |
|-------------------|-------|-------------|
| `collected`        | array | Facts the user has explicitly saved via the "add to my collection" button. |
| `recentlyMissed`    | array | Facts the user got wrong on a recent Take-25 quiz. |
| `recentlyAdded`     | array | Facts added to `collected` recently and not yet quizzed, used to weight the Take-25 draw. |

Each array holds objects of the same shape:

```json
{ "id": "2026-07-31-1", "at": "2026-07-31T14:05:00.000Z" }
```

| Subfield | Type   | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `id`     | string | A fact ID, matching `id` in `facts.jsonl` — see [`fact-store-schema.md`](fact-store-schema.md#id-format). No fact content (question/answer/topic) is ever duplicated into this document. |
| `at`     | string | ISO 8601 timestamp of when this entry was added to this list. |

## Example document

```json
{
  "collected": [
    { "id": "2026-07-31-2", "at": "2026-07-31T14:05:00.000Z" }
  ],
  "recentlyMissed": [
    { "id": "2026-07-29-4", "at": "2026-08-01T09:12:30.000Z" }
  ],
  "recentlyAdded": [
    { "id": "2026-08-02-1", "at": "2026-08-02T07:00:00.000Z" }
  ]
}
```

## Who writes what

This ticket (MAR-10) only creates the document with empty arrays on first
sign-in. The read/write logic for each list is built elsewhere:

- `collected` — written by the "add to my collection" button
  ([MAR-11](https://linear.app/mark-siebert/issue/MAR-11)).
- `recentlyMissed` / `recentlyAdded` — written once per completed Take-25
  quiz, at grading time
  ([MAR-13](https://linear.app/mark-siebert/issue/MAR-13)).

## Access control

Only the authenticated owner (`request.auth.uid == uid`) may read or write
their own document. See [`firestore.rules`](../firestore.rules) and
[`firebase-setup.md`](firebase-setup.md#5-firestore-security-rules) for how
rules are deployed.
